# cs325hw3
Files for HW3 for CS 325

All files are on the engineering flip servers in sundbebr's folders on flip3. 
To run the files there, you need to go to that cs325hw3 folder. Then:

To run shopping.py on the engineering flip servers, run the command line "python3 shopping.py"

Running the file will print the results to the terminal, but if you want to see the results file 
that the program creates on the engineering flip servers, run the command line "nano results.txt"
